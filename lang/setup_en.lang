info_text_contact#:#Here you indicate additional client information and the contact data of the system administrator of this client. The fields marked with an asterisk must be filled out. All information is stored in your database. On the next screen you may register your installation at the ILIAS-NIC server; registration transmits this data to the ILIAS-NIC server.
info_text_db#:#The database does not exist or is empty. Click the button below to install your database. If a database with the chosen name does not yet exist, please check the option 'create database'. Setup then attempts to create your database automatically. If creation should fail (i.e. due to restricted access permissions), please contact the system administrator of the database server and ask him to create a database with desired name prior to installing ILIAS.
info_text_db_collation1#:#If your desired collation is not supported in the list of UTF-8 collations, you have to create your database manually too. In any case, please make sure that the character set for the database is set to utf8.
info_text_db_collation2#:#More information about MySQL collations can be found on the MySQL website.
info_text_delete#:#You may delete this client by clicking on the delete button below. However, only your client.ini file is removed, keeping all files stored in clients data directories and the database. Files and database have to be removed manually by the system's administrator.
info_text_finish1#:#Congratulations! Your client setup were successful. Click on 'Login' to enter your ILIAS installation.
info_text_finish2#:#Some settings are still missing or incorrect. Please look at the process chart what has to be done!
info_text_first_client#:#Your basic settings have been saved. Now we will setup your first client. Setup will guide you through the installation process. On the panel to the right you can always see the current status of the installation process.
info_text_first_install#:#It seems that you install ILIAS 3 for the very first time, because no ilias.ini was found. In ilias.ini we store a master password to protect ILIAS setup from unauthorized access.
info_text_ini#:#Please choose a client ID. Any letter (except umlauts) or number is allowed. The client ID must be in one word.<br />Next you enter your database connection data. Setup establishes a test connection to verify your settings and to test if the database exists. If the database does not yet exist, you may prompt Setup in the next installation step to create the database for you.
info_text_lang#:#Please choose additional languages and/or remove selected languages. The default language specified the language for new user accounts or users which haven't selected a preferred language yet.
info_text_list#:#In this overview you see all available clients and their setup and access status. On the top right you may toggle the client selection screen on/off. If client selection is on, all available clients that are online will be displayed in a list on the start page of ILIAS. If client selection is turned off and a user views the start page, the login screen of the <i>default</i> client is displayed. You may determine the default client with the button below.
info_text_login#:#Please enter the Client ID of your Installation and your account data. Your account has to be assigned to the 'administrator'-role.
info_text_nic1#:#Obtain an installation id (nic-id) from our ILIAS server. A unique nic-id is required if you want to share content with other ILIAS installations. Registration is voluntary. If you do not want to register, select 'skip registration' (you may register later at any time).<br /> We recommend to use the online registration. If you have problems connecting (i.e. you are behind a firewall), you may obtain a nic-id via email. Please send an
info_text_nic2#:#with your installation information to ilias-info@uni-koeln.de. Enter the nic-id you will receive in a response email into the appropriate field, and select 'register via Email'.
info_text_nic3#:#You registered your installation. Your nic-id is
info_text_password#:#Here you may change the master password for the setup program.
info_text_pathes#:#ILIAS 3 supports multiple clients with different databases. Below you enter the base data directory, log file location and the paths to 3rd party programs. These settings are valid for all clients you create later on.
